# mybook_swiftui

ðŸŽ“ Trying to create a Facebook UI Clone with some capabilities like like/unlike, comment, scroll, show stories etc. This is my first swiftUI project so the code might not be beauty. 

I will combine few youtube tutorials and try to implement some of my ideas for learning purposes.
